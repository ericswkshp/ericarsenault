        I've had the pleasure of working on many different styles of websites. A
        few of my clients are photographers, real-estate agents, and tour
        guides. Whatever type of service you offer, I'm sure we can make
        something that will attract clients and represent your brand the way you
        want to!

        I spent most of my adult life working in the skilled trades, from
        repairing helicopter structures in the Army to welding on nuclear
        submarines and aircraft carriers for the Navy. It was a privelege to
        experience those careers, but after becoming a dad, I decided to pursue
        something less hazardous. A friend suggested I learn to write some code.
        I was instantly hooked after only a few minutes. I didn't know what I
        was doing, but I loved it, so I decided to go back to college and pursue
        a degree in Website Programming. I'm absolutely stoked to get to work on
        these websites each day. Whether it's for a client or for school, I know
        I'm going to learn something new every single day.
