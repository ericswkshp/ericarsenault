          I'm a web developer from Sterling Heights, MI. As a freelance
          developer, I've helped many people turn their ideas into a product
          they are proud to show their clients.

        I've had the pleasure of working on many different styles of websites. A
        few of my clients are photographers, real-estate agents, and tour
        guides. Whatever type of service you offer, I'm sure we can make
        something that will attract clients and represent your brand the way you
        want to!

        I spent most of my adult life working in the skilled trades, from a
        repairing helicopter structures in the Army, to welding on nuclear
        submarines and aircraft carriers for the Navy. It was a privelege to
        experience those careers, but after becoming a dad, I decided to pursue
        something less hazardous. A friend suggested I learn to write some code.
        I was instantly hooked after only a few minutes. I didn't know what I
        was doing, but I loved it, so I decided to go back to college and pursue
        a degree in Website Programming. I'm absolutely stoked to get to work on
        these websites each day. Whether it's for a client or for school, I know
        I'm going to learn something new every single day.
